Just create a file at /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/90-clickpad.conf with the following contents above:


Section "InputClass"
    Identifier "Clickpad"
    MatchIsTouchpad "on"
    MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
    Driver "evdev"
    # Synaptics options come here.
    Option "Clickpad" "true"
    option "EmulatedMidButtonTime" "0"
    Option "SoftButtonAreas" "65% 0 0 40% 42% 65% 0 40%"
    Option "AreaBottomEdge" "0%"
EndSection

Section "InputClass"
    Identifier   "TrackPoint"
    MatchProduct "TrackPoint"
    MatchDriver  "evdev"
    Option       "EmulateWheel"       "1"
    Option       "EmulateWheelButton" "2"
    Option       "XAxisMapping"       "6 7"
EndSection



Next step we need to make trackpoint to behave in flat mode.
KDE only: Change mouse acceleration settings to flat in advanced mouse settings.
For other DE:
Create a file at /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-mouse-acceleration.conf with the following contents below:

Section "InputClass" Identifier "evdev pointer catchall" MatchIsPointer "on" Driver "evdev" EndSection


This uses evdev driver for the trackpoint and gives you the option to set constant deceleration factor with xinput.
